# Northwestern Esports Bot
A bot for tracking the availability of the Nexus Gaming Lounge's PCs. Built to work for the Northwestern Esports Discord server.

## Features
* Provides a list of reservations currently in the system (coming soon)
* Shows the current activity of each PC in the lounge (coming soon)
* Shows the current list of games supported by the lounge (coming soon)

## Limitations
Because this bot is custom-built for the Nexus Gaming Lounge, it is not designed with interoperability with other Discord servers or GGLeap centers in mind. Retooling the bot to work with any Discord server or GGLeap center will not happen in the near future.

## Requirements
This bot runs on Python 3. All API keys are stored in `.env`.
To install, run `pip install python-dotenv requests discord.py`.
